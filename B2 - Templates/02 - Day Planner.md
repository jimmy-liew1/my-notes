## Day Planner
This is my plan for the day broken into 3 main sections:
1. [[#Morning|Morning]]
2. [[#Afternoon|Afternoon]]
3. [[#Evening|Evening]]

## Emergent Tasks
- 

## Morning
This is where I get ready for work and do my usual prep.
- 

## Afternoon
I use this time to review what I have done earlier in the day and complete any tasks to prepare for the next day.

## Evening
