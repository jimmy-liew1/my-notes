**Network endpoints** in Azure are used to secure and control access to your Azure services from your virtual network (VNet).  By configuring network endpoints, you can ensure that only resources within your VNet can access specific Azure services, without needing a public IP address.  This helps improve security by reducing exposure to public internet.
