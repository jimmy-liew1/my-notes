# Data collection rules (DCRs) in Azure Monitor
Data collection using the Azure Monitor pipeline is shown in the diagram below. Each collection scenario is defined in a DCR that specifies how the data should be processed and where it should be sent. The Azure Monitor pipeline itself consists of two components:

- **Cloud pipeline** is a component of Azure Monitor that's automatically available in your Azure subscription. It requires no configuration, and doesn't appear in the Azure portal. It represents the processing path for data that's sent to Azure Monitor. The DCR provides instructions for how the cloud pipeline should process data it receives.
- **Edge pipeline** is an optional component that extends the Azure Monitor pipeline to your own data center. It enables at-scale collection and routing of telemetry data before it's delivered to the cloud pipeline. See [Edge pipeline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-collection-rule-overview#edge-pipeline) for details on the value of this component.
