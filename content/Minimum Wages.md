A minimum wage is defined as the lowest hourly, daily or monthly remuneration that employers legally pay to their workers.  Equivalently, it is the lowest wage at which workers may sell their labor.  Most developing countries have minimum wage law which intends to guarantee low-skilled workers a wage high enough to cover their basis needs.  Such laws are popular with public policy makers because they believed to raise the incomes of the working poor will also create some inflow of cash to the market.  Thus it works as a lubricant to gear the market.  There is, of course, a downside to minimum wage legislation.  When the minimum exceeds the [[equilibrium wage]][^2], jobs are rationed and there is always a risk that unemployment could raise.

The [[minimum wage policy]] also intended to incentivize firm to move up the value chain by investing in technology and boosting productivity (Bank Negara Malaysia 2012)[^1].  While it clear that a binding minimum will lower the level of employment, but it is not so clear what impact it will have on the level of unemployment.
