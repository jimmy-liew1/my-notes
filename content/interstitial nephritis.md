Interstitial nephritis is a kidney condition characterized by swelling in between the kidney tubules, where urine is formed.  It's often caused by an allergic reaction to medications, but can also result from infections or autoimmune disorders.[^1][^2]

The main functions of your [[kidneys]] are to filter your blood and to get rid of waste from your body. The kidney tubules reabsorb water and important organic substances from the filtered blood and secrete substances you donâ€™t need into your urine for removal from your body. Swelling of these tubules can cause a number of kidney symptoms that range from mild to severe.

Interstitial nephritis can be [[acute interstitial nephritis|acute]] (sudden) or [[chronic interstitial nephritis|chronic]] (long term).

Interstitial nephritis can be life-threatening if it leads to acute kidney failure and is not treated promptly. In about half of the cases, people may experience decreased urine output and other signs of acute kidney failure.[^3] If left untreated, it can cause permanent kidney damage or even complete kidney failure.[^4] Therefore, it's crucial to seek medical attention immediately if you suspect you have this condition. Early diagnosis and treatment can improve the prognosis significantly.

## Treatment
Treatment typically involves:
- **Identifying and stopping** the use of the triggering medication.
- **Corticosteroids** may be prescribed to reduce inflammation.
- In severe cases, **dialysis** might be necessary if kidney function is significantly impaired.
- A **kidney transplant** may be considered if the damage to the kidneys is irreversible[^5].

It's essential to work closely with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action based on the individual's specific situation.
