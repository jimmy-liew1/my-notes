The design thinking process consists of:
1. **Empathize** - to understand people, within the context of your design challenge, the way they do things and why, their physical and emotional needs, how they think about the world, and what is meaningful to them.
2. **Define** - it is a design process to bring clarity and focus to the design space, based on what you learned about your user and about the context.
3. **Ideate** - it is a design process which you concentrate on idea generation.  Ideation provides both the fuel and also the source material for building prototypes and getting innovative solutions into hands of your users.
4. **Prototype** - create low-resolutions prototypes that quick and cheap to make (think minutes and cent) but can elicit useful feedback from users.  A prototype can be anything that a user can interact with - be it a wall of post-it notes, a gadget you put together, a role-playing activity, or even a storyboard.
5. **Test** - it is when you solicit feedback, about the prototypes you have created, from your users and have another opportunity to gain empathy for the people you are designing for.  Testing is another opportunity to understand your user, but unlike your initial empathy mode, you have now likely done more framing of the problem and created prototype to test.
