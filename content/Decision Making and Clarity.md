It is in your moments of DECISION that your destiny is shaped.

Deciding what shirt to wear can be easy and usually doesn’t require much thought, but what about decisions that are potentially life-changing? 🤔💭

These are my four rules for discovering CLARITY and PURPOSE in decision-making, because when it comes to tough decisions, not making one is the worst option.

1. **Write it down**. ✍
   Yes, I literally mean taking a pencil and writing it down on paper. This way you’ll have and see a physical list that helps you clearly IDENTIFY your obstacles and opportunities. 

2. **Get clear about your feelings**. 🔎
   Ask yourself: WHAT do you really want? and WHY do you want it? But you gotta be 100% transparent with yourself for this to work.

3. **Let go of fear**. 💪
   You can’t wait for certainty to come to you because it never will, take the chance on YOURSELF. Create a process that GIVES you certainty in the midst of doubt, most likely you already KNOW what this is, you just gotta do it! 

4. **Recognize your values**. ❤️
   Mostly all tough decisions will have more than ONE outcome. Ask yourself: What’s really number one for me? Then repeat the process for number 2, number 3, etc.
