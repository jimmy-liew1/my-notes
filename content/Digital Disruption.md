Digital disruption is the change that occurs when new digital technologies and business models affect the value proposition of existing goods and services.[^1]

Generally, digital disruption happens after a [[digital innovation]], such as [[big data]], [[machine learning]] (ML), [[Internet of Things]] (IoT) or the bring your own device ([[BYOD]]) movement.  Digital innovation affects how customer expectations and behaviors evolve, causing organizations to shift how they create products and services, produce marketing material and evaluate feedback.  This shift in digital strategy can occur on an individual, organizational, industry or societal level.

The term digital disruption often misused to describe any product involving digital technology or the use of digitization to better compete against market peers.  It is often confused with the termÂ [disruptive technology](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/disruptive-technology), a term coined by Harvard Business School professor Clayton M. Christensen to describe a new technology that displaces an established technology.

Digital disruption is a constant threat due to the velocity of technical change, or [[202209151228 - digital innovation|digital innovation]].  Emerging technologies such as [[AI]], [[machine learning]] and [[blockchain]] are driving significant automation and breaking down barriers to entry.
