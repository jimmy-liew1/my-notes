Before your team begins a Scrum sprint, you need to know where you’re going. This is where the sprint planning meeting comes in. A sprint planning meeting should be one of the longest Scrum meetings you hold—plan on two hours of planning for each week of your sprint. (A two week sprint, for example, requires roughly a four hour planning meeting.) While this may seem like a lot, remember that you only need to hold one sprint planning meeting per sprint—right at the start. 

The purpose of a sprint planning meeting is simple: Establish what you and your Scrum team want to accomplish this sprint and evaluate the bandwidth you have available. From there, you can plan the sprint, assigning tasks and setting deadlines. Make sure each team member understands the ins and outs of the tasks they are assigned. You’ll want to invite the product owner to this meeting so they can clear up any ambiguities and help establish expectations.
