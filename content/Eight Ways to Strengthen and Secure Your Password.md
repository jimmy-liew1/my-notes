**Passwords are secret words, phrases, or collections of characters** that must be correctly entered to gain access to a specific resource.

Cybercriminals are always looking for ways around the security measures your organization has in place. One of the easiest ways they can do that is by guessing or cracking your weak password.

## Best Practices for Creating a Strong Password
Tips below to learn more about **how to make a strong password.**

### Tip 1: Word Choice Matters
Don’t create passwords using information that can be easily found online, such as:
-   Pet’s or people’s names
-   Addresses or postal codes
-   Key dates like a birthday or an anniversary

>**Note:** This also applies to security questions.

### Tip 2: Don’t Reuse Passwords
One of the main ways cybercriminals access your accounts is by trying passwords you have used elsewhere.

### Tip 3: Longer Passwords are Stronger
The absolute minimum length is eight characters, but 16 or 20 characters are even more secure!

### Tip 4: Keep It Unique
Use numbers and special characters to alter regular dictionary words, and don’t use simple patterns like “password1, password2, password3” for different sites.

### Tip 5: Use a Passphrase
Passphrases are a sentence-like string of words that are easy to remember but difficult to crack. For example, “jellyfish-apple-1600-pirate” or a few nonsense words like “Betty was eating tires and playing tuna fish.”


## Ways to Ensure Your Passwords Are Secure
1. **Don’t Share Passwords** - Keep your passwords private; never share them with anyone else.
2. **Don’t Write Them Down** - Passwords written on sticky notes or pieces of paper at your desk are no more secure than locks containing keys.
3. **Use a Password Manager** - Many organizations use password manager software to help employees create and store complex passwords.
